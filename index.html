And another FHS fan, she also impresses us with her great talent despite her short age, her most frequent drawing type being OC's and Ships' FanArt's, one she loves from FHS is GoldenXFreddy / Golddy, despite showing others. On Youtube, your videos boil down to SpeedPaint's and Memes. And in his DrevianArt, he usually publishes a little bit of everything, although there aren't so many drawings of her there, it's still a network where she's active.</h2>
